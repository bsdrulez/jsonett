=== OBJECTIVE ===
Command line tool to convert json to java properties and vice versa

=== Notes ===
All public interface has function name in the form:
    "ett" + _ + <module name> + _ + <function name>
where <module name> is a single lowercase word, while <function name> is
lowercase and can be made by more underscore separated words.

A binary tree has been chosen as the interface data structure between JSON
format and Java Properties. Therefore both the interfaces of json module and java
properties module provide a parsing function and a print function to convert
the structure of the data from string to binary tree and vice versa.

=== IMPROVEMENTS ===

propett.c:
    - create a suitable module for the List
    - the function"print_node" is a variant of the visit_pref;
      clear the functions visit_[rsb]{3} and create the function
      with hook pre-son, post-son, etc.

propett.c/jsonett.c:
    - generarize the interface parse/print for better extension
    - use the data structure provided by glib2 instead of custom List and
      Stack

jsonett.c:
    - make parse return the Bintree pointer so there is no need for double
      root of the json bintree (see also FIXME in wtt_json_print)
    - remove warning from cast ponter->char
    - dind more elegant solution to do-while break line 78
